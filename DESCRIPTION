Description: Allows remote access to satellite image time 
    series provided by the web time series service (WTSS) available 
    at servers such as <https://brazildatacube.dpi.inpe.br/wtss/>. 
    The functions include listing the data sets available in WTSS servers, 
    describing the contents of a data set, and retrieving a time series 
    based on spatial location and temporal filters.
